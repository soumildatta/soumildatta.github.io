I am a Ph.D. candidate @ Kahlert School of Computing, University of Utah. My main research interests are in the field of ML/AI security, trustworthiness, and efficiency. I work with Professor [Guanhong Tao](https://tao.aisec.world) at the SaLT Lab. My primary motivation is to uncover vulnerabilities and aid in the development of models that are not only robust, secure, and transparent, but also efficiently designed. 

During my Masters study at the University of Mississippi, I worked on my thesis under the guidance of [Dr. Charles Walter](https://engineering.olemiss.edu/people-charles-walter/), focusing on exploring the vulnerabilities and behavior of object detection models against adversarial attacks. I also developed and evaluated more efficient inference-time adversarial attacks for state-of-the-art object detector models. 

In the past, I worked with Genetic Algorithms (GA) to explore algorithm optimizations, and created a GA based [artistic reconstruction algorithm](https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/items/ab5363b0-4431-4a5f-8199-0bcdf5f07acf). Additionally, as part of my diverse research experiences, I was part of the [Heterogeneous Research Lab (HEROES)](https://john.cs.olemiss.edu/heroes/) where I researched on the development of a concurrent priority queue, as well as highly concurrent algorithms such as an [improved SSSP algorithm](https://github.com/soumildatta/SpeculateAndCorrect-SSSP), and a GPU scheduler for generational dependencies. I was also part of the [High Fidelity Virtual Environments Lab](http://www.hi5lab.org/doku.php?id=main:members), where I developed VR environments to test the effects of optical illusions in 3D space, and to test the accuracy of AR tracking through streaming services such as video conferencing.

[GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io). -->
